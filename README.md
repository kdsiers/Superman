Presentation for CP
Why Superman is not a good Agile Team Member
Would you pick Superman to be on your Agile Team? An energizing, comical and always debatable discussion about the dynamics of an Agile Team from a developer’s perspective. Are you able to code projects in a single bound? We will discuss why becoming a developer on an Agile Team is very different than anything you have ever done before! It does not matter if you are transitioning from a highly process-oriented waterfall world or an extremely relaxed, open, possibly cowboy coding environment… a transition must happen. We will focus on the struggles that all great developers incur during this transition and a few things you can do to prepare for the impact. 
In the end, I hope to convince you that Superman is not beneficial to a collaborative team. So put on your cape and let’s get moving!
